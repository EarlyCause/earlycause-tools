Here are some facts about the development and characteristics of the prenatal and postnatal early-life stress (ELS) scores constructed for this project. These are global ELS measures, intended to capture exposure to cumulative psycho-social risk during fetal life and across childhood (i.e., until the age of 10 years) respectively. The scores were constructed based on data from Generation R and ALSPAC cohorts.
